# Branching
- step 01: To check branch you use gut branch
- step 02: To move and create a branch use  $ git checkout -b branch-name
           If it already exists just use git checkout <branch-name>
 
## Upstreaming remote and local branches
- Pull requests always balance git remote branches
- If we want to balance LOCAL main and task/development-branch
    - git checkout main
    - git pull (take code from git main branches)
